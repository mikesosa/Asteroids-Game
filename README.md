# Asteroids-Game
This project took me about 7 days roughly speaking, since I worked on it sporadicly. It was a personal challenge since I was a kid, to build this videogame helped me to gain confidence with python programming. It was builted with Pygame wich is a library created specifically for game development.

All sprites(images) were taken from www.opengameart.org where you can find anything you might be looking for when it comes to videogames development. Sound effects were created with https://www.bfxr.net/ very cool tool.
